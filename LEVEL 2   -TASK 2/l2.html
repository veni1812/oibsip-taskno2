            I admire  M.S.Dhoni for Dhoni’s Leadership Qualities
One of the primary reasons behind Dhoni’s respect is his exceptional leadership qualities. 
As the captain of the Indian cricket team, he led by example, instilling confidence and belief in his teammates. 
Dhoni’s ability to remain calm and composed under pressure situations earned him the reputation of being unflappable, a trait admired by both teammates and opponents.
Dhoni, often hailed as one of the greatest cricketers of all time, has earned immense respect and admiration from fans, players, and cricket pundits alike. 

 He connects with fans, inspires cricketers and is an ambassador of hope and possibility for youngsters dreaming big.
As captain he was statesmanlike, dignified, a general in battle with the composure of a monk, a reassuring presence in extreme stress. Celebration on reaching a landmark is not violent gestures or abusive screams, just an old- world raising of the bat.
 MSD is not shy of making a loud statement.

 Love for the Army is worn on the sleeve and, occasionally, on his keeping gloves. In the Rashtrapati Bhavan to receive the Padmashri, Lt Col Dhoni marched like a soldier. 
After the World Cup, he disappeared to train in Kashmir keeping selectors in suspense about his availability. This, when his photos—playing golf in the US and billiards in Ranchi—circulated in the media.

Exceptional Leadership: Dhoni is known for his calm and composed demeanor on the field, which earned him the title of "Captain Cool." He led the Indian cricket team to numerous victories, including the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, and the pinnacle of success, the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup.
